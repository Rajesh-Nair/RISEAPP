<h2 id="section-1.-purpose-and-scope">Section 1. Purpose and Scope</h2>
<p>This section forms part of a synthetic Model Risk Management Policy,
created solely for testing, assurance, and demonstration purposes. It is
not issued by, endorsed by, or affiliated with the UK Prudential
Regulation Authority. The structure, tone, and intent are inspired by
supervisory statements such as SS 1/23, but all content is
fictional.</p>
<p>The purpose of this section is to define expectations around the
governance, development, validation, implementation, and ongoing
monitoring of models used within a regulated financial services
organisation. A model is defined as a quantitative or qualitative
method, system, or approach that applies statistical, financial,
economic, or mathematical theories, assumptions, and data to produce
outputs that inform business decisions.</p>
<p>This policy applies to all material models, including but not limited
to credit risk models, market risk models, operational risk models,
capital and liquidity models, stress testing models, pricing models, and
models based on machine learning or other advanced analytics
techniques.</p>
<p>The organisation is expected to maintain a complete and accurate
inventory of models, ensure proportional application of controls based
on materiality, and demonstrate effective oversight by senior management
and the Board. Clear accountability must be established across the model
lifecycle, from initial design through retirement.</p>
<p>Compliance with this policy supports safe and sound decision-making,
reduces the likelihood of model-driven losses, and enhances transparency
with regulators, auditors, and other stakeholders.</p>

<h2 id="section-16.-purpose-and-scope">Section 16. Purpose and
Scope</h2>
<p>This section forms part of a synthetic Model Risk Management Policy,
created solely for testing, assurance, and demonstration purposes. It is
not issued by, endorsed by, or affiliated with the UK Prudential
Regulation Authority. The structure, tone, and intent are inspired by
supervisory statements such as SS 1/23, but all content is
fictional.</p>
<p>The purpose of this section is to define expectations around the
governance, development, validation, implementation, and ongoing
monitoring of models used within a regulated financial services
organisation. A model is defined as a quantitative or qualitative
method, system, or approach that applies statistical, financial,
economic, or mathematical theories, assumptions, and data to produce
outputs that inform business decisions.</p>
<p>This policy applies to all material models, including but not limited
to credit risk models, market risk models, operational risk models,
capital and liquidity models, stress testing models, pricing models, and
models based on machine learning or other advanced analytics
techniques.</p>
<p>The organisation is expected to maintain a complete and accurate
inventory of models, ensure proportional application of controls based
on materiality, and demonstrate effective oversight by senior management
and the Board. Clear accountability must be established across the model
lifecycle, from initial design through retirement.</p>
<p>Compliance with this policy supports safe and sound decision-making,
reduces the likelihood of model-driven losses, and enhances transparency
with regulators, auditors, and other stakeholders.</p>

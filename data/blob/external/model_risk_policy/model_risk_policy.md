# Model Risk Management Policy
## Section 1. Purpose and Scope
This section forms part of a synthetic Model Risk Management Policy, created
solely for testing, assurance, and demonstration purposes. It is not issued
by, endorsed by, or affiliated with the UK Prudential Regulation Authority.
The structure, tone, and intent are inspired by supervisory statements such
as SS 1/23, but all content is fictional.
The purpose of this section is to define expectations around the governance,
development, validation, implementation, and ongoing monitoring of models
used within a regulated financial services organisation. A model is defined
as a quantitative or qualitative method, system, or approach that applies
statistical, financial, economic, or mathematical theories, assumptions, and
data to produce outputs that inform business decisions.
This policy applies to all material models, including but not limited to
credit risk models, market risk models, operational risk models, capital and
liquidity models, stress testing models, pricing models, and models based on
machine learning or other advanced analytics techniques.
The organisation is expected to maintain a complete and accurate inventory
of models, ensure proportional application of controls based on materiality,
and demonstrate effective oversight by senior management and the Board. Clear
accountability must be established across the model lifecycle, from initial
design through retirement.
Compliance with this policy supports safe and sound decision-making, reduces
the likelihood of model-driven losses, and enhances transparency with
regulators, auditors, and other stakeholders.

Regulatory Context</h2>
<p>This document is a synthetic model risk policy created exclusively
for testing, assurance, and demonstration purposes. It is not issued by,
endorsed by, or affiliated with the UK Prudential Regulation Authority.
The structure and tone are inspired by SS 1/23, but all content is

<p>This policy establishes comprehensive and proportionate standards for
the management of model risk across the organisation. Model risk arises
from the potential for adverse consequences resulting from decisions
based on incorrect or misused model outputs. Such risk may stem from
limitations in data quality, inappropriate assumptions, conceptual
soundness weaknesses, implementation errors, or inappropriate use.
Effective management of model risk is therefore a critical component of
the organisation’s overall risk management framework, internal control
environment, and governance arrangements. Senior management and the
Board are expected to demonstrate clear ownership of model risk outcomes
and ensure that model risk is identified, measured, monitored, and
controlled in a manner consistent with the organisation’s risk appetite.

This policy establishes comprehensive and proportionate standards for

from the potential for adverse consequences resulting from decisions

limitations in data quality, inappropriate assumptions, conceptual
soundness weaknesses, implementation errors, or inappropriate use.
Effective management of model risk is therefore a critical component of
the organisation’s overall risk management framework, internal control

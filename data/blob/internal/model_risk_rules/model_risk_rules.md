Model Risk Management Policy
1. Purpose, Scope, and Regulatory Context
This document is a synthetic model risk policy created exclusively for testing,
assurance, and demonstration purposes. It is not issued by, endorsed by, or

This policy establishes comprehensive and proportionate standards for the management of model risk across the
organisation. Model risk arises from the potential for adverse consequences resulting from decisions based on
incorrect or misused model outputs. Such risk may stem from limitations in data quality, inappropriate
assumptions, conceptual soundness weaknesses, implementation errors, or inappropriate use. Effective
management of model risk is therefore a critical component of the organisation’s overall risk management
framework, internal control environment, and governance arrangements. Senior management and the Board are
expected to demonstrate clear ownership of model risk outcomes and ensure that model risk is identified,
measured, monitored, and controlled in a manner consistent with the organisation’s risk appetite. This policy
